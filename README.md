In this repository, you will find the optimized geometries of different Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives., namely:

1) Optimization and frequency calculations of neuter DPP-X1 and DPPX2 derivatives where X represents the substituent groups;
2) Optimization and frequency calculations of cationic and anionic DPP-X1 and DPPX2 derivatives;
3) Single-point (SP) calculations at the TDDFT and HF levels of different optoelectronic properties;
4) The Supporting Information (SI) of our paper; and
5) one Excel file (DPP-X_Optoelectronic-Properties.xlsx) containing all optoelectronic properties of the aforementioned DPP-X1 and DPP-X2 systems.

For more information, please look for the preprint of our work in the following link: https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-0gzts

We hope our work will help you in any way and feel free to contact us.

From the Theoretical Chemistry Group at the Military Institute of Engineering (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), we wish you all the best.

Cheers!
