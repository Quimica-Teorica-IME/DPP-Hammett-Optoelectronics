In this repository, you will find different files related to Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives, namely:

1) Optimization and frequency calculations of a neuter DPP system;
2) Optimization and frequency calculations of a cationic and an anionic DPP system;
3) Single-point (SP) calculations of a neuter DPP system;
4) The entire Supporting Information (SI) of our paper; and
5) One Excel file (DPP-X_Optoelectronic-Properties.xlsx) containing all optoelectronic properties of DPP-X1 and DPP-X2 systems, where X represents the substituent groups.

Keep in mind that the ORCA files uploaded here refer to only one DPP system, but all other calculations for all other DPP-X derivatives follow the exact input.

For more information, please look for the the published paper of our work in the following link: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.27195

We hope our work will help you in any way.

Please feel free to contact us for any questions, demands, and/or comments and suggestions.

From the Theoretical Chemistry Group at the Military Institute of Engineering (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), we wish you all the best.

Cheers!
